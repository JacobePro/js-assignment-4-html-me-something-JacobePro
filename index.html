               <p>
                  Some of the criticism that the Buccaneers defense has taken is warranted, however, this defense could get healthy at the right time. Plus, they have something they didn’t have last year: championship experience. 
                  Buccaneers running back Leonard Fournette, who missed the rest of the regular season, is expected back for the playoffs helping the Bucs offense greatly.
                  Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady is- rightfully- in the MVP discussion. He has thrown for an NFL-best 4,580 yards and 37 touchdown passes against 11 interceptions at the age of 44. 
                  Would it surprise anyone if Tom Brady and the Buccaneers were the last men standing in the NFC and victorious in the Super Bowl once again?

               <p>
                  There are more than enough reasons to believe that the Chiefs will secure another Super Bowl win. 
                  It's hard to identify any offense with better weapons than Patrick Mahomes, Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Tyreek Hill, and Travis Kelce. 
                  Kansas City has just enough firepower to hold off opposing offenses on the other side of the ball. Chris Jones and Tyrann Mathieu are elite defensive players and will provide leadership to a Chiefs defense that lacks depth and experience in some positions. 
                  Regardless, Kansas City doesn’t have to shut teams down completely; they just need to contain them.

                  Aaron Rodgers... That's all we could say and almost no NFL fan would bat an eye.
                  Aaron Rodgers is currently on the road to winning NFL MVP, and for good reason!
                  With guys getting banged up on both sides of the ball, Aaron Rodgers keeps the ball moving (literally and metaphorically)!
                  Not to mention a top 10 defense if everyone stays healthy! Is Green Bay ready for Rodgers to lead once again?
